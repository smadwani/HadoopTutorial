Load and Store data in Pig:

We know underlying pig is Map Reduce and in MR we know, loading data means INPUT_DATA_FORMAT and storing data means OUTPUT_DATA_FORMAT.
So whatever Input formats MR supports, same can be done in PIG and whatever Output formats supported by MR, same can be used for 
storing files by PIG.

Generally to load any file in PIG we use STORAGE TYPE like

BinStorage - Loads and stores data in machine-readable format.
PigStorage - Loads and stores data in UTF-8 format. 
PigDump - Stores data in UTF-8 format
TextLoader - Loads unstructured data in UTF-8 format, TextLoader cannot be used to store data.
These are out of the box provided Load/Storage types, we have many more Storer and Loaders in Pig like
1. CommonLogLoader()
2. CSVExcelStorage()
3. FixedWidthLoader()
4. JsonLoader()
5. BSONLoader()
6. MongoLoader()
7. DBStorage()
Here I am going to discuss 4 Storage:
1. PigStorage
2. TextLoader
3. CSVExcelStorage
4. JsonLoader
